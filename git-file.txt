Gates did not keep his title of top philanthropist for long.
The women are great
 In that same month that Gates left Microsoft, Warren Buffett announced that he planned to give away his stake in Berkshire-Hathaway, the company he founded, worth more than $44 billion. Buffett will divide the gift over five foundations, but the largest amount will go to the Gates Foundation. Buffett’s donation exceeds the amounts given by the great philanthropists of the past. Andrew Carnegie’s giving totaled about $380 million—$7.6 billion in today’s dollars. Based on the Berkshire stock price on the day the gift was announced, Buffett’s gifts would be worth $37 billion. Because the donation is in the form of Berkshire stock shares given over time, the total donation could grow in value as the company grows.
